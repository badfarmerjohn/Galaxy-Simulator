<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>

In this project, we built a simple galaxy simulator that is visually compelling. Given a certain galaxy image, we are able to initialize particles and physically simulate them. We have both CPU particles, which make up the physically simulated particles in our galaxy, and GPU particles which are used for realistic visual effects which are not part of the physical simulation. In our simulation, the GPU particles are used to mimic real phenomena such as space dust which are present in the simulation but do not affect the dynamics of the N-body system. 

<h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Galaxy Image Preprocessing</h3>

The python script takes in a galaxy image and splits it into blocks. Then, it first takes the average pixel value of each block and exports that as a 2D array in some text file. The python script also does the same for the HSV values from each block, exporting those distributions to other text files. Then in the unity code, we sampled particle location and colors from these distrubutions, similar to how we did Monte Carlo integration from previous projects.

<h2 align="middle">Physics Simulation</h2>
<p>
  The main problem we aimed to tackle with this project was how to simulate real gravitational N-Body dynamics systems while still keeping a high framerate and particle count.
  This became a task to find a healthy balance between performance optimizations and loss of realism. We implemented and compared 3 different systems to simulate the physics of our galaxy.
  To look at the performace of our different systems, we compared the framerate of our simulation to the number of particles being simulated on the CPU.
</p>

    Our first method to simulate the N-Body physics of our galaxy was to use a 1:1 implementation of real life physics. Essentially, each particle in the system is given a force equal to 
    the sum of all gravitational forces between it and every other particle in the system. This method, while the most physically accurate, is the slowest, as each call to update particle 
    positions takes O(n^2) operations in terms the number of simulated particles.

    The final method we implemented in simulating N-Body dynamics in our galaxy is the circular orbit approximation method. Each particle is given a force equivalent to the total 
    mass of the system being concentrated at the center of mass of the galaxy. This method is constant time per particle update, so the simulation update call is O(n) overall, and allows for 
    the greatest number of particles to be simulated on the CPU. The physical accuracy of this system decreases the further towards the center of the galaxy, as particles closer to the center are given a force as if 
    all other mass was inside of their orbit, even though there are many particles further away in orbit than the centered particles are. As a result, particles which are far away from the galactic center 
    of mass have pretty realistic behavior, while particles in the center may move erratically at times.
