<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>

In this project, we built a simple galaxy simulator that is visually compelling. Given a certain galaxy image, we are able to initialize particles and physically simulate them. We have both CPU particles, which make up the physically simulated particles in our galaxy, and GPU particles which are used for realistic visual effects which are not part of the physical simulation.

<h2 align="middle">Status Report</h2>

<p>We have accomplished the foundational behavior for the camera in Unity, CPU particles (which will make up the physically simulated particles in our galaxy), and GPU particles (which will be used for realistic visual effects which are not part of the physical simulation). The CPU particles will have their positions updated by computing the dynamics of an N-body gravitational system. The GPU particles will be used to mimic real phenomena such as space dust which are present in the simulation but do not affect the dynamics of the N-body system. The preliminary results are that we are able to manage the particles and incrementally add more particles using Unity. We have plans to implement mathematical models for galaxies. One of the ideas we will be implementing is to have a galaxy model based off of the gaussian distribution on the x and z axis. Then for the y axis, we uniformly sample in the range of the guassian distribution. In terms of our progress relative to our plan, we are bit behind, as there are have been some changes to our plans. One thing we found out is that the GPU particles cannot be physically simulated, so we had to make large changes to our project. We plan to make this up by meeting up more this week for longer hours.
