<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>

In this project, we built a simple galaxy simulator that is visually compelling. Given a certain galaxy image, we are able to initialize particles and physically simulate them. We have both CPU particles, which make up the physically simulated particles in our galaxy, and GPU particles which are used for realistic visual effects which are not part of the physical simulation. In our simulation, the GPU particles are used to mimic real phenomena such as space dust which are present in the simulation but do not affect the dynamics of the N-body system. 

<h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Galaxy Initialization</h3>
<h4>Position Initialization</h4>
<p>
  One unforseen challenge in the project was initializing the galaxy. While we may be able to simulate the particle's position and velocity in the next time step given the state of the galaxy in the current timestep, we need to give all the particles initial positions and velocities. In addition, although the particles don't change size, color, or mass in this version of the simulator, they still need to be initialized to some value. The challenge is to do this realistically so that it resembles a galaxy initially. The realism afterward is then left to the simulation time-stepping.
</p>
<p>
  We realized that the position of any single particle is not as important as the overall distribution of the particles. Therefore, we used a reference galaxy image as a reference for the distribution of particles from which we sampled positions. Ideally, this would be a decently high resolution image of a galaxy from a bird's eye view. Using a Python script, we segment the image into tiles and compute the average luminance of the tile, which we take as the relative density of particles in that area of the galaxy. We then normlize these densities and use them to describe a discretized probability distribution (think: buckets).
<p>
  For each particle, we sample two random variables and use the inversion method similar to what was used in importance sampling in Project 3-2 to find the corresponding tile of the original image that this particle should be spawned in. Wihtin that tile, we uniformly sample the position of the particle (indendently in each axis). The method was inspired by the importance sampling used in <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp19/article/29/assignment-3-2,-part-3-environme">environment mapping section</a>. Again, the distribution is based off the relative luminance of the different tiles. Critical in this method is the assumption that luminance is a good estimate of the particle density of that section of the galaxy. This is works conveniently for our simulation task since in space, everything of visual significance is either emitting or reflecting light. We note that this assumption does not work well in many other types of simulation, including space simulation requiring a high degree of accuracy, as there are many things that don't emit or reflect light (eg. black holes, dark matter, etc) that would greatly affect the gravity simulations.
</p>
<p>
  We also note that with more buckets, the initial galaxy looks more realistic, as it can capture a lot of the emtpy spaces between, say, different arms of the galaxy. For regular images, using each pixel as a bucket is very reasonable, since at such scales, even a single pixel is representing a large part of the galaxy. As the number of buckets decreases (and thus the size of each bucket increases), the buckets become more conspicuous in the final simulation, as you can see the boundaries of each bucket (particles seem to form a loose rectangular prism).
</p>
<p>
  Another trick we used to get a more realistic galaxy is to increase the contrast of the galaxy image. While that makes the reference image look less aesthetically pleasing, it helps push the resulting distribution be more pronounced, encouraging particles to be spawned near the center and arms of the galaxy. The "bushiness" of the galaxy is not greatly affected since the randomness within a tile adds "bushiness".
</p>
<h4>Color Initialization</h4>
<p>
  We employed a similar approach to assign colors to each particle. Using the same image tiles as above, we calculated the color statistics on each tile. Specifically, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the hue, saturation, and value values in each tile. When a particle was initialized in a specific tile, the hue, saturation and value of its color would be sampled from a gaussian distribution with the mean and standard deviation of that tile.
</p>
<h4>Velocity Initialization</h4>
Velocity was initialized proportional to the square root of the total mass of the galaxy and inversly proportional to the square root of the distance of the particle from the center. The reasoning behind this was purely visual, because we didn't want the particles farther away from the center, which had a weaker pull towards the center, to have too high of a velocity and thus fly out of the galaxy.

<h2 align="middle">Physics Simulation</h3>
<p>
  The main problem we aimed to tackle with this project was how to simulate real gravitational N-Body dynamics systems while still keeping a high framerate and particle count.
  This became a task to find a healthy balance between performance optimizations and loss of realism. We implemented and compared 3 different systems to simulate the physics of our galaxy.
  To look at the performace of our different systems, we compared the framerate of our simulation to the number of particles being simulated on the CPU.
</p>

<p>
    Our first method to simulate the N-Body physics of our galaxy was to use a 1:1 implementation of real life physics. Essentially, each particle in the system is given a force equal to 
    the sum of all gravitational forces between it and every other particle in the system. This method, while the most physically accurate, is the slowest, as each call to update particle 
    positions takes O(n^2) operations in terms the number of simulated particles.
</p>

<p>
    Another physics method we implemented in simulating N-Body dynamics in our galaxy is the circular orbit approximation method. Each particle is given a force equivalent to the total 
    mass of the system being concentrated at the center of mass of the galaxy. This method is constant time per particle update, so the simulation update call is O(n) overall, and allows for 
    the greatest number of particles to be simulated on the CPU. The physical accuracy of this system decreases the further towards the center of the galaxy, as particles closer to the center are given a force as if 
    all other mass was inside of their orbit, even though there are many particles further away in orbit than the centered particles are. As a result, particles which are far away from the galactic center 
    of mass have pretty realistic behavior, while particles in the center may move erratically at times.

    (DESCRIPTION OF HASHING METHOD)
</p>
<p>

<p>
    Here are the results for all three methods put together:

<p>
    The circle approximation performed roughly as well as the spatial hashing approach, and both of these do much better than the naive algorithm as expected. However, since we 
    are conceding some physical accuracy for both methods compared to the naive, it is important to look at the drawbacks of this performance gain. With spatial hashing, we lose the fine 
    details in the direction of forces since particle forces are grouped into buckets rather than each having individual directions. With circular approximation, particles towards the center 
    have less realistic orbiting behavior. These visual errata are small, and are not nearly as noticable as the steep framerate drop that occurs when using the naive force calculations, so the other 
    methods are preferrable for such a large simulation.
